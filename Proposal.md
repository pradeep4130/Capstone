# Telco Customer Churn

**Problem statement:**  Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.

**Who will benefit:** Telecommunications sector use applications of predictive analytics for churn modeling, because customer retention is an essential part of most financial services' business models and 
the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. Companies from this sector often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more 
to a company than newly recruited clients

**Data source:**  The data will be aquired from dataset [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/telecom-customer-churn-prediction/notebook) available on Kaggle.com
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.
The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The “Churn” column is our target
